This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming: attempting to modify a value through an immutable reference. The `bug.rs` file contains code that correctly uses mutable references, while the commented-out section highlights the error that occurs when trying to use an immutable reference for modification. The `bugSolution.rs` file is identical for this example. Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable references is crucial for writing safe and correct Rust code.
